## Assignment 2: Machine Learning Pipeline I

The task here is to predict who will experience financial distress in the next two years. We have access to other information about this person (as described in the data dictionary). Your assignment is to take this data and build a machine learning pipeline that trains one machine learning model on the data. 

The goal of this assignment is to build a simple, modular, extensible, machine learning pipeline in Python. 

The write-up (including the application of pipeline) is fully contained in the homework_2 notebook. The pipeline itself is built in pipeline_v1.py. The raw data (in CSV format) is in the data folder. The dataset is a modified version of data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit.
